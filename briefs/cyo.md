# Choose Your Own Project

If none of the other projects have captured your imagination, you can come up with your own MVP.

It must meet the following guidelines:

- It should use Vue for the front-end, and Express / MongoDB for the back end
- It should use at least one API (your own or an external API)
- It must handle interaction from the user (demonstrate an understanding of events)

You might choose to practice working with some of the following:

- Charts
- Maps
- Canvas
- Vuetify
- Sound

If you choose to work on your own project, you *must* present an MVP and planning to an instructor for approval by Friday at the latest.
